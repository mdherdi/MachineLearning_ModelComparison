Activity recognition with healthy older people using a batteryless wearable sensor Data Set

Sparse
Noisy
Passive batteryless, wearable sensor
age 66-86
scripted activities

Activities:
	walking to the chair,
	sitting on the chair,
	getting off the chair,
	walking to bed,
	lying on bed,
	getting off the bed and
	walking to the door.
Labels:
	- Sitting on bed
	- Sitting on chair
	- Lying on bed
	- Ambulating, where ambulating includes standing, walking around the room.
	
Column 1: Time in seconds
Column 2: Acceleration reading in G for frontal axis
Column 3: Acceleration reading in G for vertical axis
Column 4: Acceleration reading in G for lateral axis
Column 5: Id of antenna reading sensor
Column 6: Received signal strength indicator (RSSI)
Column 7: Phase
Column 8: Frequency
Column 9: Label of activity, 1: sit on bed, 2: sit on chair, 3: lying, 4: ambulating
Column 10: 0: Male, 1:Female
